## To start npm in specific folder 
```bash
npm init
```
## install specific version:

1. npm i package_name@version

```bash
npm i underscore@1.3.2
```

2. npm list to check all the packages in your project

```bash
npm list
```

install the mongoose version 5.11.14

```bash
npm i mongoose@5.11.14
```

to check whether the installed dependencie's versions are outdated or not

```bash
npm outdated
```

output

```bash
PS C:\Mudik Training\NodeJS\New folder (2)> npm outdated
Package     Current   Wanted  Latest  Location                 Depended by
mongoose    5.11.14  5.13.14   6.5.2  node_modules/mongoose    New folder (2)
underscore    1.3.2   1.13.4  1.13.4  node_modules/underscore  New folder (2)

```

```bash
npm update
```

#### to install the npm-check-updates so that it will check whether the latest versions of the packages are available or not

-g : global flag

```bash
npm i -g npm-check-updates
```

#### ncu is a shortform for npm-check-updates

-u : to update the packages to the latest available versions

check the package.json file

```javascript
"dependencies": {
    "mongoose": "^5.11.14",  // check version
    "underscore": "^1.3.2"
  }
```

```bash
ncu -u
```

shortform for updating the version (major version) it will change only package.json and will not install the latest version of packages
to install you can do npm i

```bash
npm list
npm i
```

## devDependencies

in production environment dev dependencies are not required.

package.json file:

```javascript
{
  "name": "npm-demo",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
    "mongoose": "^5.11.14",
    "underscore": "^1.3.2"
  }
}

```

```bash
npm i jshint --save-dev

# OR

npm i jshint -D
```

post this command our package.json will be:

```javascript
{
  "name": "npm-demo",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
    "mongoose": "^5.11.14",
    "underscore": "^1.3.2"
  },

  //  this is dev dependencies
  "devDependencies": {
    "jshint": "^2.13.5"
  }
}

```

set the node env to production to check whether package.json will install jshint or not with npm i command

but before goto node modules folder and delete jshint that you installed earlier without removing it from package.json file

then do this commands:

```bash
set NODE_ENV=production

npm i

```

check whether your node_modules folder have jshint module folder or not?
it should not be there as we have set the environment to production

### to Uninstall the package

npm un packagename

```bash
npm un mongoose
```

all the global packages are in this directory:

```bash
C:\Users\SidheshP\AppData\Roaming\npm

```

install nodemon package to global:
nodemon: helps to keep running the project / server

(as we were keep starting and stopping the server last time for the http package program) nodemon will do this for us.

```bash
npm i nodemon -g
```

## We are going to publish our package to npm repository:

pair with another person

<br />
step 1. create new folder and name as :fresher222-yourname
and write a addition of numbers function

<br />

```bash
npm init -y
```

step 2: create index.js file and write this code:

```javascript
function addNumbers(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
module.exports.addNumbers = addNumbers;
```

this code will be written by another person:

```javascript
function multiplyNumbers(a, b) {
  return a * b;
}
module.exports.multiplyNumbers = multiplyNumbers;
```

post that create account on npmjs.org

open cmd in to this newly created application

```bash
npm login
```

type your username, password, email and otp

once you get this message in cmd:

```bash
Logged in as username on https://registry.npmjs.org/.
```

to publish the package just type command:

```bash
npm publish
```

install the package in another folder/application
then try to use it

to update the package version (minor)

```bash
npm version minor
```

to update the package version (patch)

```bash
npm version patch
```

to update the package version (major)

```bash
npm version major
```

not add another feature in your package

```javascript
function subtractNumbers(a, b) {
  return a - b;
}
module.exports.subtractNumbers = subtractNumbers;
```

go to cmd: type

```bash
npm version minor
```

this will update your package version to
v1.1.0

```bash
npm publish
```
